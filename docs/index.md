# Docs index

- **Structure**: `docs/structure.md` — Source vs. patterns vs. dist layout, build/deploy flow.
- **Fonts**: `docs/fonts.md` — Self-hosted fonts (Ubuntu bundled) and CDN example.
- **Patterns**: `scripts/build-patterns.js` and `README` sections — `npm run patterns` to render includes into `public/pages/`; use `npm run patterns:watch` for live rebuilds and `npm run serve:patterns` to preview.
